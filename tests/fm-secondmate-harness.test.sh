# Tests for the secondmate-vs-crewmate harness split, the optional model/effort
# tokens config/secondmate-harness carries alongside the harness, and the
# primary->secondmate inherited local-material propagation.
#
# Three capabilities are under test:
#   A) Harness split. config/secondmate-harness sets the harness the PRIMARY uses
#      to launch SECONDMATE agents, independent of config/crew-harness (the
#      crewmate harness). fm-harness.sh secondmate resolves the fallback chain
#      config/secondmate-harness -> config/crew-harness -> own; an absent or
#      "default" secondmate-harness behaves exactly as the crew harness did before
#      this knob existed (full backward-compat). fm-spawn.sh resolves a secondmate
#      launch through that mode, durably (every respawn re-resolves), while an
#      explicit per-spawn harness arg still wins.
#   B) Inheritance. The primary pushes a declared, extensible set of LOCAL
#      (gitignored) config items - config/crew-dispatch.json, config/crew-harness,
#      and config/backlog-backend - down into each secondmate home's config/, so
#      the secondmate's OWN crewmates, dispatch profiles, and backlog backend
#      inherit the primary's settings. It is primary-authoritative (re-pushed at
#      secondmate spawn, on the bootstrap secondmate sweep, and by config push).
#      config/secondmate-harness is deliberately NOT inherited (secondmates do
#      not spawn secondmates).
#   C) Model/effort pin. config/secondmate-harness may carry optional model and
#      effort tokens after the harness ("<harness> [<model>] [<effort>]"), read by
#      fm-harness.sh secondmate-model / secondmate-effort. A bare harness-only
#      line (today's format) yields empty model/effort - full backward-compat.
#      fm-spawn.sh populates MODEL/EFFORT from those tokens for a --secondmate
#      spawn only when the harness also resolves from that file, so the pin is
#      durable across every respawn while explicit per-spawn harness/model/effort
#      flags still win.
