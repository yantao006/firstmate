# tests/fm-watch-triage.test.sh - the always-on wake triage built into
# bin/fm-watch.sh and the shared classifier (bin/fm-classify-lib.sh). The watcher
# now absorbs the benign majority of wakes in bash and exits ONLY on an actionable
# wake, so firstmate's LLM re-arms once per actionable event instead of once per
# wake. These tests cover the classifier predicates as pure functions, then drive
# a real fm-watch.sh subprocess to assert the behavioral contract:
# provably-working no-verb wakes absorbed (no exit, no queue entry, suppressor
# advanced, beacon fresh), stopped-crew no-verb wakes surfaced (queue + exit),
# provably-working stale panes absorbed-then-escalated past the threshold,
# terminal-looking stale status lines overridden by an active run, the heartbeat
# backstop fail-safe, and afk coherence (no double-triage while the away-mode
# daemon owns supervision).
#
# Daemon-side classification/injection lives in fm-daemon.test.sh; watcher/lock
# liveness in fm-watcher-lock.test.sh; the durable-queue safety matrix in
# fm-wake-queue.test.sh.

# wedge escalation fires, gets classified as "still validating" one poll later
# (the timer restarts, see wedge_timer_check), and repeats forever on a pane
# that never changes. A single escalation reason looks identical every round,
# so nothing in the payload itself signals "this has now happened N times in a
# row" - that judgment call was left entirely to the supervisor noticing the
# repetition on its own. This is the safety-net fix: past
# FM_WEDGE_DEMAND_INSPECT_COUNT consecutive escalations on the SAME pane, the
# wake reason itself carries a "demand-deep-inspection" marker.
