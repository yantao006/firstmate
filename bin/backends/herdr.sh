# bin/backends/herdr.sh - the herdr session-provider adapter (EXPERIMENTAL).
#
# Design: data/fm-backend-design-d7/herdr-addendum.md ("Interface mapping",
# decisions D1-D6) and the empirical verification recorded in
# data/fm-backend-design-d7/herdr-verification-p2.md (real herdr v0.7.1,
# protocol 14, macOS aarch64), refined by docs/herdr-backend.md's
# "workspace-per-home" pass (AGENTS.md task herdr-sm-spaces-k4). Herdr is a
# session provider ONLY (D3): the worktree provider stays treehouse, exactly
# like tmux. Sourced only through bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_source in
# normal operation; the unit tests source it directly, so the FM_HOME fallback
# below keeps that path sane without fm-backend.sh's preamble.
#
# Container shape (D4, decided empirically - see herdr-verification-p2.md
# "Task container shape", refined by docs/herdr-backend.md "Task container
# shape"): ONE herdr workspace PER FIRSTMATE HOME (the primary, and each
# secondmate, gets its own), ONE herdr TAB per task inside its home's
# workspace. Workspace-per-task was tried and rejected (bad human-watching
# ergonomics); workspace-per-HOME keeps that same rejection while giving every
# home its own space, labeled distinctly, in the shared spaces sidebar. Target
# resolution and the human-watch story stay parallel to the tmux adapter.
#
# Target string shape: "<herdr-session>:<pane-id>", e.g. "default:w1:p2" (the
# pane id itself contains a colon; the session is always the FIRST field, the
# remainder is the whole pane id - fm_backend_herdr_parse_target splits on the
# first colon only). This is the value stored in a herdr task's meta window=
# field and is what fm_backend_resolve_selector already returns unchanged for
# both the fm-<id> and explicit backend-target forms (that function has no
# herdr-specific logic; it just returns meta's window= verbatim).
#
# Recovery/orphan discovery (ids may not deterministically match live state
# after a server restart in a differently-configured session; see the
# verification doc) uses LABEL matching (fm-<id> tab labels), never trusts a
# stored pane id blindly: fm_backend_herdr_list_live.
#
# Requires: herdr (CLI + socket), jq (JSON parsing). Both are gated behind
# selecting this backend; bin/fm-bootstrap.sh's core tool list is unaffected.

# FM_HOME fallback: every real caller (fm-spawn.sh, fm-peek.sh, fm-send.sh,
# fm-teardown.sh, fm-watch.sh, fm-crew-state.sh) already sets FM_HOME as a
# global before sourcing fm-backend.sh (which sources this file), so this
# never overrides a real invocation. It exists only so this file's own unit
# tests, which source it directly without that preamble, resolve to a sane
# default (the firstmate repo root - never a secondmate home, so
# fm_backend_herdr_workspace_label falls through to "firstmate" exactly like
# pre-P3 behavior when a test does not care about home-specific labeling).

# create_task time - see the incident note below). Best-effort: a failure
# here never fails the caller, mirroring the fm_backend_herdr_kill `|| true`
# contract.
#
# Live-fire incident fix (2026-07-02): the prior implementation
# (fm_backend_herdr_workspace_prune_default_tabs, removed) re-derived
# "prunable" at create_task time from a pure label heuristic - exactly one
# tab, labeled "1" - run against whatever workspace fm_backend_herdr_workspace_find
# had just resolved. Herdr enforces no label uniqueness (docs/herdr-backend.md
# "Label collisions") and derives an unlabeled workspace's DISPLAYED label from
# its pane cwd's basename, so a captain launching herdr directly inside a
# directory named "firstmate" produces a workspace that looks byte-identical,
# by label alone, to firstmate's own auto-created container - one tab, label
# "1". workspace_find adopted that pre-existing (captain-owned, LIVE) workspace
# by the label match, the heuristic matched too, and the very next spawn
# closed the captain's own live pane 27ms after creating its task tab. The
# fix is structural, not another heuristic: only a workspace THIS SAME
# fm_backend_herdr_workspace_ensure call just created carries a non-empty
# seeded_tab_id at all (see FM_BACKEND_HERDR_WS_SEEDED_TAB_ID below); an
# ADOPTED workspace's seeded_tab_id is always empty, so create_task never
# calls this function for one, regardless of how its tabs happen to be
# labeled.
#
# Defense in depth on top of that gate (not the primary safety mechanism):
# re-verify <seeded_tab_id> is still present, still carries label "1" (a
# human could have renamed or repurposed it in the interim), and refuse to
# close it if its pane hosts an actively working agent per herdr's own
# agent-state detection (`agent get`) - belt-and-suspenders against any other
# unforeseen path landing a live agent in a tab this function was about to
# close.
#
# Verified real-herdr behavior (not modeled by the canned-response fake-CLI
# unit tests; modeled by make_herdr_statefake): closing a workspace's LAST
# remaining tab deletes the whole workspace, not just the tab. So this must
# never run while the seeded default tab is still the ONLY tab in the
# workspace - callers only invoke it once at least one other (real task) tab
# exists alongside it, never right after workspace creation - and this
# function independently re-checks the tab count as a second layer.

# fm_backend_herdr_create_task: create the task's tab (one pane) in
# <container> ("session:workspace_id"). Herdr does NOT enforce label
# uniqueness itself (verified: two tabs can share a label), so the duplicate
# check is ours, mirroring tmux's manual check.
#
# A same-labeled tab already existing no longer means an automatic refusal:
# herdr persists and restores its whole session layout (workspaces/tabs/
# panes) across a server restart, including a reboot, and a restored fm-<id>
# task tab comes back a HUSK - a dead pane, or (today, and unconditionally
# once a future `resume_agents_on_restore = false` config ships) a plain
# agent-less shell sitting in the saved cwd, never the crewmate that used to
# be there. Before this fix, every fleet respawn after such a restart needed
# the operator to manually close each husk pane first before firstmate could
# spawn into it again. fm_backend_herdr_tab_is_husk classifies the existing
# tab's pane conservatively (dead or no-agent only; anything live or
# ambiguous refuses exactly as before) and, when it is a confirmed husk,
# this function CLOSES AND REPLACES it instead of refusing.
#
# Ordering is deliberate: the REPLACEMENT tab is created FIRST, and the husk
# is closed only AFTER that succeeds - never the reverse. Closing a
# workspace's LAST remaining tab deletes the whole workspace on real herdr
# (docs/herdr-backend.md "Workspace lifecycle"), and a session-restore husk
# can legitimately be that workspace's only tab (e.g. its own seeded default
# tab was already pruned, long before the restart, by a prior real task tab
# existing alongside it). Herdr's lack of label-uniqueness enforcement is
# exactly what makes this safe: the new and the husk tab can briefly share
# the same label with no error, so the workspace never drops to zero tabs.
# This mirrors fm_backend_herdr_workspace_prune_seeded_default_tab's own
# create-before-close safety argument.
#
# --no-focus: verified tab create never focuses by default regardless of
# sibling tabs, so this is defense in depth rather than a behavior change.
# <seeded_default_tab_id> (4th arg, may be empty) is exactly the value
# fm_backend_herdr_workspace_ensure captured as FM_BACKEND_HERDR_WS_SEEDED_TAB_ID
# for THIS SAME container - non-empty only when this spawn's own
# container_ensure call just created the workspace. Once the real task tab
# above is created, this is the ONLY input that may trigger a prune, and it is
# passed by the caller, never re-derived here from tab list contents or
# labels (the live-fire self-kill fix - see
# fm_backend_herdr_workspace_prune_seeded_default_tab for the incident and
# the safety argument). An ADOPTED workspace's caller always passes an empty
# 4th arg, so this function never even queries for a prune candidate in that
# case. Echoes "<tab_id> <pane_id>" on success.

# Verification strategy (incident 2026-07-03: two grok/herdr crewmates left a

# reading "Enter:send", while fm-send exited 0): a prior version of this
# function verified submission by diffing raw pane content before/after
# Enter - ANY change counted as "submitted". Live-verified against real grok
# 0.2.82: a slash command's first Enter closes the completion popup and, for
# an argument-taking command, EXPANDS the composer text into an argument-hint
# placeholder ("/compact" -> "/compact compaction instructions") rather than
# submitting - the raw pane content visibly changes (popup gone, text
# different) even though nothing was sent, so the old diff-based check
# false-positived "empty" (submitted) after exactly one Enter, precisely
