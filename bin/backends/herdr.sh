# bin/backends/herdr.sh - the herdr session-provider adapter (EXPERIMENTAL).
#
# Design: data/fm-backend-design-d7/herdr-addendum.md ("Interface mapping",
# decisions D1-D6) and the empirical verification recorded in
# data/fm-backend-design-d7/herdr-verification-p2.md (real herdr v0.7.1,
# protocol 14, macOS aarch64), refined by docs/herdr-backend.md's
# "workspace-per-home" pass (AGENTS.md task herdr-sm-spaces-k4). Herdr is a
# session provider ONLY (D3): the worktree provider stays treehouse, exactly
# like tmux. Sourced only through bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_source in
# normal operation; the unit tests source it directly, so the FM_HOME fallback
# below keeps that path sane without fm-backend.sh's preamble.
#
# Container shape (D4, decided empirically - see herdr-verification-p2.md
# "Task container shape", refined by docs/herdr-backend.md "Task container
# shape"): ONE herdr workspace PER FIRSTMATE HOME (the primary, and each
# secondmate, gets its own), ONE herdr TAB per task inside its home's
# workspace. Workspace-per-task was tried and rejected (bad human-watching
# ergonomics); workspace-per-HOME keeps that same rejection while giving every
# home its own space, labeled distinctly, in the shared spaces sidebar. Target
# resolution and the human-watch story stay parallel to the tmux adapter.
#
# Target string shape: "<herdr-session>:<pane-id>", e.g. "default:w1:p2" (the
# pane id itself contains a colon; the session is always the FIRST field, the
# remainder is the whole pane id - fm_backend_herdr_parse_target splits on the
# first colon only). This is the value stored in a herdr task's meta window=
# field and is what fm_backend_resolve_selector already returns unchanged for
# exact task-id, legacy fm-<id>, and explicit backend-target forms (that
# function has no herdr-specific logic; it just returns meta's window=
# verbatim).
#
# Recovery/orphan discovery (ids may not deterministically match live state
# after a server restart in a differently-configured session; see the
# verification doc) uses LABEL matching (fm-<id> tab labels), never trusts a
# stored pane id blindly: fm_backend_herdr_list_live.
#
# Requires: herdr (CLI + socket), jq (JSON parsing). Bootstrap detects these
# through fm_backend_required_tools only when herdr is the resolved backend;
# this adapter also gates them again before spawning.

# FM_HOME fallback: every real caller (fm-spawn.sh, fm-peek.sh, fm-send.sh,
# fm-teardown.sh, fm-watch.sh, fm-crew-state.sh) already sets FM_HOME as a
# global before sourcing fm-backend.sh (which sources this file), so this
# never overrides a real invocation. It exists only so this file's own unit
# tests, which source it directly without that preamble, resolve to a sane
# default (the firstmate repo root - never a secondmate home, so
# fm_backend_herdr_workspace_label falls through to "firstmate" exactly like
# pre-P3 behavior when a test does not care about home-specific labeling).

# create_task time - see the incident note below). Best-effort: a failure
# here never fails the caller, mirroring the fm_backend_herdr_kill `|| true`
# contract.
#
# Live-fire incident fix (2026-07-02): the prior implementation
# (fm_backend_herdr_workspace_prune_default_tabs, removed) re-derived
# "prunable" at create_task time from a pure label heuristic - exactly one
# tab, labeled "1" - run against whatever workspace fm_backend_herdr_workspace_find
# had just resolved. Herdr enforces no label uniqueness (docs/herdr-backend.md
# "Label collisions") and derives an unlabeled workspace's DISPLAYED label from
# its pane cwd's basename, so a captain launching herdr directly inside a
# directory named "firstmate" produces a workspace that looks byte-identical,
# by label alone, to firstmate's own auto-created container - one tab, label
# "1". workspace_find adopted that pre-existing (captain-owned, LIVE) workspace
# by the label match, the heuristic matched too, and the very next spawn
# closed the captain's own live pane 27ms after creating its task tab. The
# fix is structural, not another heuristic: only a workspace THIS SAME
# fm_backend_herdr_workspace_ensure call just created carries a non-empty
# seeded_tab_id at all (see FM_BACKEND_HERDR_WS_SEEDED_TAB_ID below); an
# ADOPTED workspace's seeded_tab_id is always empty, so create_task never
# calls this function for one, regardless of how its tabs happen to be
# labeled.
#
# Defense in depth on top of that gate (not the primary safety mechanism):
# re-verify <seeded_tab_id> is still present, still carries label "1" (a
# human could have renamed or repurposed it in the interim), and refuse to
# close it if its pane hosts an actively working agent per herdr's own
# agent-state detection (`agent get`) - belt-and-suspenders against any other
# unforeseen path landing a live agent in a tab this function was about to
# close.
#
# Verified real-herdr behavior (not modeled by the canned-response fake-CLI
# unit tests; modeled by make_herdr_statefake): closing a workspace's LAST
# remaining tab deletes the whole workspace, not just the tab. So this must
# never run while the seeded default tab is still the ONLY tab in the
# workspace - callers only invoke it once at least one other (real task) tab
# exists alongside it, never right after workspace creation - and this
# function independently re-checks the tab count as a second layer.

# fm_backend_herdr_create_task: create the task's tab (one pane) in
# <container> ("session:workspace_id"). Herdr does NOT enforce label
# uniqueness itself (verified: two tabs can share a label), so the duplicate
# check is ours, mirroring tmux's manual check.
#
# A same-labeled tab already existing no longer means an automatic refusal:
# herdr persists and restores its whole session layout (workspaces/tabs/
# panes) across a server restart, including a reboot, and a restored fm-<id>
# task tab comes back a HUSK - a dead pane, or (today, and unconditionally
# once a future `resume_agents_on_restore = false` config ships) a plain
# agent-less shell sitting in the saved cwd, never the crewmate that used to
# be there. Before this fix, every fleet respawn after such a restart needed
# the operator to manually close each husk pane first before firstmate could
# spawn into it again. fm_backend_herdr_tab_is_husk classifies the existing
# tab's pane conservatively (dead or no-agent only; anything live or
# ambiguous refuses exactly as before) and, when it is a confirmed husk,
# this function CLOSES AND REPLACES it instead of refusing.
#
# Ordering is deliberate: the REPLACEMENT tab is created FIRST, and the husk
# is closed only AFTER that succeeds - never the reverse. Closing a
# workspace's LAST remaining tab deletes the whole workspace on real herdr
# (docs/herdr-backend.md "Workspace lifecycle"), and a session-restore husk
# can legitimately be that workspace's only tab (e.g. its own seeded default
# tab was already pruned, long before the restart, by a prior real task tab
# existing alongside it). Herdr's lack of label-uniqueness enforcement is
# exactly what makes this safe: the new and the husk tab can briefly share
# the same label with no error, so the workspace never drops to zero tabs.
# This mirrors fm_backend_herdr_workspace_prune_seeded_default_tab's own
# create-before-close safety argument.
#
# --no-focus: verified tab create never focuses by default regardless of
# sibling tabs, so this is defense in depth rather than a behavior change.
# <seeded_default_tab_id> (4th arg, may be empty) is exactly the value
# fm_backend_herdr_workspace_ensure captured as FM_BACKEND_HERDR_WS_SEEDED_TAB_ID
# for THIS SAME container - non-empty only when this spawn's own
# container_ensure call just created the workspace. Once the real task tab
# above is created, this is the ONLY input that may trigger a prune, and it is
# passed by the caller, never re-derived here from tab list contents or
# labels (the live-fire self-kill fix - see
# fm_backend_herdr_workspace_prune_seeded_default_tab for the incident and
# the safety argument). An ADOPTED workspace's caller always passes an empty
# 4th arg, so this function never even queries for a prune candidate in that

# herdr's CLI exposes no cursor-row primitive (unlike tmux's #{cursor_y}), so
# this locates the composer structurally, recognizing THREE shapes and keeping
# whichever match comes LAST (scanning forward), so a shape earlier in
# scrollback/a popup can never outrank the real (bottom-anchored) composer:
#
#   bordered - a boxed composer (verified grok 0.2.82): the row's TRIMMED
#              content both STARTS and ENDS with the same border glyph (│, ┃,
#              or a plain ASCII |). The box's own top/bottom rows use rounded
#              corners (╭─…─╮ / ╰─…─╯), which never match; popup item rows and
#              horizontal separator rows carry no border glyph at all; the
#              footer help line ("Enter:send │ … │ …") uses │ only as an
#              INTERIOR separator and does not start with one, so it never
#              matches either.
#   bare     - an UNBORDERED composer (verified real claude 2.x and codex
#              0.142.x, both under herdr 0.7.1, docs/herdr-backend.md
#              "Incident (2026-07-07)"): the row's TRIMMED content starts with
#              one of the verified agent-specific prompt glyphs but carries no
#              closing border at all - claude's own live input row is a bare
#              "❯ …" with no surrounding │, and codex's is a bare "› …". Both
#              harnesses ALSO render bordered decorative boxes elsewhere (a
#              startup welcome banner, an update-available notice) that
#              satisfy the bordered shape above; requiring a match on EITHER
#              shape and keeping the last (bottom-most) one is what keeps the
#              live composer winning over a stale decorative box still sitting
#              in the same capture window - a bordered box is only ever
#              followed later on screen by the actual live composer, never the
#              reverse, in every harness observed so far. The bare shape is
#              deliberately narrower than the bordered content classifier so a
#              no-agent shell fallback prompt (`>`, `$`, `%`, or `#`) falls
#              through to `unknown` instead of being misread as delivered.
#   separated - Pi's composer is one or more content rows between two solid
#              horizontal `─` separator rows, with no prompt glyph or side
#              borders. This shape is accepted ONLY when Herdr's native
#              `agent get` identifies the target as Pi and reports it idle,
#              done, or blocked. A missing/stale/non-Pi agent identity, a
#              working Pi, an over-tall candidate, or an incomplete separator
#              pair remains unknown. This identity + structure conjunction is
#              what makes a blank Pi row safe without weakening dead-shell or
#              ambiguous-pane refusal.
#
#   empty   - blank, a bare prompt glyph, known ghost/placeholder text
#             ("Type a message...", verified grok 0.2.82's empty-composer
#             placeholder), or only de-emphasised ANSI ghost/placeholder text
#             recognized by the shared fm_composer_strip_ghost extractor
#             (dim/faint or dark-TRUECOLOR foreground). Safe to treat as
#             submitted.
#   pending - real, unsubmitted text sits in the composer. This deliberately
#             also covers a slash-command popup that just closed but only
#             auto-completed or filled an argument-hint placeholder into the
#             composer (e.g. "/compact" -> "/compact compaction
#             instructions", verified live against real grok 0.2.82) - that
#             first Enter is a SELECTION, not a submission.
#   unknown - the pane could not be read, or no composer row (of either shape)
#             was found in the captured window.
#
# Ghost/placeholder note: herdr's ANSI pane read preserves the harness's own
# de-emphasis styling, and the classifier extracts real typed content with the
# shared fm_composer_strip_ghost (bin/fm-composer-lib.sh), which drops dim/faint
# runs (claude's rotating prompt suggestion, codex's idle suggestion after the
# bare `›` prompt) AND dark/muted truecolor foreground runs (grok's placeholder),
# while keeping non-de-emphasised real typed input. This is the same owner the
# tmux adapter routes through, so the two backends cannot drift (task
# afk-herdr-false-pending); it superseded a herdr-only faint byte-pattern check
# that recognized only codex's bold-wrapped bare prompt and missed claude's own

# confirms a real turn started. Verified hazard (herdr-verification-p2.md
# "slash/$ autocomplete popup"): a `/`- or `$`-prefixed send opens a
# completion popup within ~0.1s, exactly like tmux's claude/codex popups, so
# the caller's <settle> before the first Enter matters here the same way it
# does for tmux.
#
# Confirmation signal (rewritten for the 2026-07-07 incident below;
# superseded a composer-content read that itself replaced a delta-based check
# for the 2026-07-03 incident): when the target is legibly idle before Enter,
# submission is confirmed by fm_backend_herdr_wait_for_working observing a
# submit-active agent_status after Enter, NOT by reading the composer's own
# row. This makes the normal confirmation path cross-agent: it is the same
# semantic signal regardless of what text a harness's idle composer happens
# to display.
#
# Incident (2026-07-07, followed up on 2026-07-08): a redelivery loop in the
# away-mode daemon. Root cause: composer-content submit confirmation was too
# sensitive to harness rendering details. Real claude/codex use bare prompt
# rows, and real codex adds dynamic idle suggestions after `›`; the later
# ANSI-aware composer classifier now handles the pre-injection guard for that
# Codex shape, but idle-baseline submit confirmation deliberately stays on
# native agent-state so delivery does not depend on composer text. Composer
# content is retained for other callers (the away-mode daemon's PRE-injection
# empty-box guard, still dispatched via fm_backend_composer_state /
# fm_backend_herdr_composer_state) and for submit attempts whose pre-Enter
# agent-state baseline is not legibly idle.
#
# This also still correctly handles the earlier 2026-07-03 incident (a
# slash-command popup selection/placeholder-fill on the FIRST Enter is not a
# genuine submission) without any popup-specific logic at all: filling a
# composer placeholder never starts a turn, so agent_status simply never
# reports "working" for that Enter, and the retry loop below sends a second
# Enter exactly as it did before - the fix generalizes instead of special-
# casing the popup shape.
#
# Failure-mode analysis (the two directions the caller-facing contract must
# not get wrong - see docs/herdr-backend.md "Native agent-state submit
# confirmation" for the empirical timing behind this):
#   - Slow transition: fm_backend_herdr_wait_for_working samples repeatedly
#     across herdr's per-attempt confirmation budget (not once at the end), so a
#     transition landing partway through a window is still caught before this
#     loop gives up and sends a needless extra Enter.
#   - Instant round-trip (a turn starts AND returns to idle between two
#     polls): unavoidable in the absolute, but bounded by how tightly polls
#     are packed into the budget; real claude/codex measured first-working
#     at 90-490ms, comfortably inside a several-hundred-ms, multiply-sampled
#     window, so this has not been observed in practice. On the (unobserved)
#     residual chance it happens, the verdict is "pending" and the caller
#     never retypes - only re-sends Enter, which lands on an already-empty
#     composer and is a no-op, not a duplicate delivery of <text> (see
#     fm-send.sh/fm-supervise-daemon.sh: retyping only happens if a caller
#     re-invokes this function from scratch with the same text after seeing
#     an error, which is a human/escalation decision, not an automatic
#     retry).
# Echoes empty|pending|unknown|send-failed, the SAME vocabulary fm-send.sh
# already branches on for tmux ("empty" means "confirmed submitted" for every
# backend; how each backend confirms it is an internal decision - herdr's is

#             what fooled the OLD confirmation on codex's dynamic idle-tip
#             text). Returned the INSTANT it is seen, without waiting out the
#             rest of the budget.
#   idle    - the target was legibly read at least once and never reported
#             "busy" across the whole window - a genuine "not (yet)
#             submitted" signal, not a read failure. The caller retries
#             Enter on this verdict.
#   unknown - EVERY poll in the window failed to read the target at all (a
#             hard I/O failure - pane gone, socket error - not a timing
#             race). The caller must not keep retrying Enter against a target
#             it cannot even read.
#
# <polls> spread across <budget-seconds> (rather than one check at the end)
# is what makes this robust against a SLOW transition: a caller now gets
# several samples across that window instead of a single one, so a transition
# that lands partway through is not missed just because it had not landed by
# the FIRST sample.
# Empirical evidence (docs/herdr-backend.md "Native agent-state submit
# confirmation"): real claude and codex observed first-working at 90-490ms
# after Enter, so a several-hundred-ms budget sampled repeatedly reliably
# catches it. The remaining, inherent gap - a turn so fast it starts AND
# returns to idle between two samples - is bounded by how tightly <polls> is
# packed into <budget-seconds>; nothing observed in real testing has come

# (the policy, not the subscription, makes `blocked` the sole immediate action)
