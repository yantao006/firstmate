# fm-supervise-daemon.sh — presence-gated sub-supervisor (closes #27's P2).
#
# Wraps bin/fm-watch.sh: runs it as a child, classifies each wake reason, and
# either SELF-HANDLES the routine majority in bash (no firstmate turn) or
# ESCALATES a batched, distilled digest to the supervisor pane on
# captain-relevant events only. This is the token-efficient replacement for the
# prior always-inject daemon: routine signal/stale/heartbeat wakes cost zero
# firstmate context; only done/needs-decision/blocked/failed/persistent-wedge/
# check-output events reach the LLM, and even then as one pre-read digest per
# batch window.
#
# PRESENCE-GATING (the /afk contract). The daemon is the away-mode engine: it
# injects ONLY when the durable away-mode flag state/.afk is present. Invoking
# the /afk skill sets that flag and starts this daemon; any real (unmarked)
# user message clears it and firstmate resumes full responsiveness.
# When afk is off, normal fm-watch.sh always-on triage is the active mechanism.
# Any buffered daemon escalations that remain while afk is off survive in
# state/.subsuper-escalations and are flushed on the next "while you were out"
# catch-up or when afk is re-entered.
#
# IN-BAND SENTINEL MARKER. Every daemon injection is prefixed with
# FM_INJECT_MARK (ASCII unit separator, 0x1f) — a byte a human would never type
# at the start of a message. Firstmate's contract: a message that starts with
# the marker is an internal escalation (stay afk); a message without it means
# the captain is back (exit afk, flush catch-up, resume per-wake responsiveness).
# The marker and the busy-guard solve the same problem — the daemon and the
# human share one input channel — so they live together under /afk.
#
# Reliability model (see the /afk skill):
#   - Nothing is lost in away mode: while state/.afk exists, the watcher reverts
#     to daemon-owned one-shot behavior and enqueues every wake to
#     state/.wake-queue BEFORE advancing its suppression markers, so a
#     crash/restart/missed injection is recovered on the next fm-wake-drain.sh.
#     The daemon does not touch the queue; it only reads the watcher's stdout
#     reason.
#   - Fail-safe-to-escalate: any wake the classifier cannot confidently mark
#     routine is escalated.
#   - Bounded wedge latency: a stale pane is escalated only after it has been
#     idle for STALE_ESCALATE_SECS (configurable), rechecked once. A wedged
#     crewmate is therefore detected within STALE_ESCALATE_SECS + a tick, never
#     lost. Crewmates are autonomous, so a delayed stale response does not stall
#     a healthy crewmate's own progress.
#     Buffered escalation delivery also has a max-defer alarm: if a digest stays
#     undelivered past FM_MAX_DEFER_SECS, the daemon retries a normal flush and
#     writes state/.subsuper-inject-wedged if submit still cannot be confirmed.
#   - Cheap heartbeat catch-all: every HEARTBEAT_SCAN_SECS the daemon greps all
#     state/*.status for a captain-relevant line the per-wake classifier might
#     have missed (e.g. a status verb outside CAPTAIN_RE) and escalates it.
#
# The robustness shell from the prior always-inject version is preserved:
# single-instance lock (portable helper, no flock dependency), crash-loop
# backoff, pane-gone guard, and a signal-trapped shutdown that flushes buffered
# escalations before exit.
#
# Usage: fm-supervise-daemon.sh

#          sets state/.afk first. Env knobs:
