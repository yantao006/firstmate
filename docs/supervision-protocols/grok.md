Mode: Grok background-notify supervision.

When this session owns supervision and away mode is not active:
1. Drain first with `bin/fm-wake-drain.sh`.
2. Source `__FM_X_MODE_ENV__` first when X mode is active.
3. Arm with Grok's tracked background tool, as its own call:

   `run_terminal_command` with `background: true` on:
   `[ -f __FM_X_MODE_ENV_SH__ ] && . __FM_X_MODE_ENV_SH__; exec bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`

4. Trust only the arm's one-line status.
5. `watcher: started ...` or `watcher: attached ...` means a live cycle exists.
   On attach, the background task stays live until that existing cycle ends; it does not exit immediately.
6. `watcher: FAILED ...` means supervision is down; fix and re-arm.
7. After a successful start or attach status, end the turn.
   The background arm remains the live wait until the cycle ends.
8. Waiting is silent.
9. Never use shell `&` for firstmate supervision.
10. Never bundle the arm onto another command.
    A shell `&`, a truncating pipe, or bundling is denied automatically by the PreToolUse seatbelt (`bin/fm-arm-pretool-check.sh`) whenever this project's Grok hooks are trusted.

Grok injects a synthetic user message with `synthetic_reason: task_completed` when the background arm completes.
When you see a background-task-completed system reminder for the arm:
1. Run `bin/fm-wake-drain.sh` first.
2. Optionally fetch arm output with `get_command_or_subagent_output(<task_id>)` for the reason line.
3. Handle `signal`, `stale`, `check`, or `heartbeat` using the harness-neutral contract in `AGENTS.md`.
4. Re-arm the next cycle with the same background `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` call if work remains in flight or X mode still needs polling.
5. Do not invent a wake from an attach-status line alone.
   Drain the queue and act only on real wake records or a real watcher reason line.
   Re-arm attaches to an existing cycle when one is already healthy, so the background task stays live until that cycle ends.

Grok Stop hooks are passive.
The primary project hook runs `bin/fm-turnend-guard-grok.sh`, which forces at most one same-session follow-up via `grok --resume` when a turn would end blind.
That is a backstop, not the normal wake path.
After any forced follow-up, arm the watcher with the background protocol above.

Interactive TUI primary sessions are the supported supervision host.
Headless `grok -p` may wait for background process exit but does not reliably surface full auto-wake model output; do not run the primary firstmate as a one-shot headless process.
